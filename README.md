# Tractrix Model Analysis
Codes used in O'Brien et al. (2021) to derive the tractrix model of the magnetopause, optimize it, and generate figures detailing its performance.

Consists of four scripts:
1. mcmc.py, a script used to explore the parameter space of the model in order to find the optimal set of parameters for the model.
1. mcmc_loader.py, a script used to load the chain generated by mcmc.py, extract the maximum likelihood parameters, and generate a corner plot of the posterior.
1. SW_pressure.py, a script used to generate a histogram of solar wind pressure sources.
1. plotting.py, a script used to generate all other figures in the paper.

If you make use of this code, please cite the paper from which the model was derived:
